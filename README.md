Uplift
======

Bearwaves' first game, a multi-platform, sci-fi action RPG.

Uplift is an action RPG game built primarily for Android platforms, but has support for desktop and iOS too due to being written with LibGDX. The game is not being actively worked on at present due to the fact we don't have an artist any more - if you're into art, please do drop us a line.
